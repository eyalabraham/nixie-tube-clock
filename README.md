**SPI Command interface**
| Command byte  |    Response   |  Second transmit byte  |    Response                |
|:-------------:|:--------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------|
|    1          |     dummy     | Minutes digit          | Current Minutes digit      |
|    2          |     dummy     | 10s minutes digit      | Current 10s minutes digit  |
|    3          |     dummy     | Hours digit digit      | Current Hours digit digit  |
|    4          |     dummy     | 10s hours digit        | Current 10s hours digit    |
|    5          |     dummy     | Brightness 0 to 10     | dummy                      |
|    6          |     dummy     | dummy                  | Get light sensor 0 to 255  |
|    7          |     dummy     | dummy                  | Code rev in 2 nibbles      |
|   85          |     dummy     | dummy                  |     170                    |

Commands 1 through 4 are used to send new digits to be displayed on the Nixie tubes.
A value of 0 to 9 displays digits 0 to 9, a value greater than 9 blanks a digit.
The response to the second byte allows to check what the controller is currently displaying, by comparing the digit sent to the controller to the one returned from it.

Brightness command with value 0 turns off all segment by turning off high voltage, values 1 through 10 control the brightness from low to high.

The notation 'dummy' denotes a dummy byte of 0xff that is sent or received by ignored.

Command number 85 (0x55) is a keep alive and check for response 170 (0xAA). This command is sent periodically: if there is no response from the AVR, the RPi will issue a reset on GPIO8, if it is not received by the AVR, the AVR will blank the display and fast-flash the seconds LED.

10. RPi and AVR will exchange keep-alive messages every 10sec,
    if RPi fails to communicate with AVR it will issue a reset through GPIO8
    if AVR fails to communicate with RPi it will blank the Nixie Tubes and fast-flash the seconds LED
## Miscellaneous
### Python GPIO library choice
There are several choices for a Python GPIO library for the Raspberry Pi. These include GPIO.ZERO, RPi.GPIO, spidev based library and possibly more.
This project uses the bcm2835 'C' library and the matching Python bindings. The bcm2835 library is actively updated, and supports all GPIO options of the Raspberry Pi, including SPI, I2C, GPIO, PWM etc. The library is a compiled 'C' library, but with the Python bindings it provides full functionality for both C and Python without any need for kernel drivers. The Python binding is not up to date with the bcm2835, but is sufficiently easy to update.
